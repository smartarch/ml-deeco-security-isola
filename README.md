# ML-DEECo for Security rules

This is an accompanying repository to the paper *Ensemble-based modeling abstractions for modern self-optimizing systems* by Milad Abdullah, Michal Töpfer, Tomáš Bureš, Petr Hnětynka, and Martin Kruliš.

It also serves as a replication package for Master thesis *Machine-learning-based self-adaptation of component ensembles* by Michal Töpfer.

## Contents

There are several folders in this repository:
